    content: `One of the most powerful features of Prospectify is its ability to unify your marketing insights across multiple platforms. In the real world, this is made possible through official APIs provided by social networks and analytics tools ‚Äî allowing Prospectify to securely pull performance metrics, audience data, and campaign results into one easy-to-use dashboard.\n\n1. Facebook & Instagram (Meta Graph API)\nProspectify connects to the Meta Graph API to access your Facebook Pages and Instagram Business Accounts. With user consent, it can:\n- Retrieve post engagement, reach, and audience demographics\n- Track ad campaign performance\n- Monitor follower growth over time\n\n2. LinkedIn (Marketing API)\nThrough LinkedIn‚Äôs Marketing API, Prospectify can pull:\n- Ad campaign metrics (impressions, clicks, conversions)\n- Company page analytics\n- Audience insights for B2B targeting\n\n3. Google Analytics (Data API)\nFor website and campaign tracking, Prospectify integrates with the Google Analytics Data API to show:\n- Real-time traffic metrics\n- Conversion tracking\n- Multi-channel attribution reports\n\n4. Twitter/X (API)\nWhen connected to the Twitter API, Prospectify can:\n- Track tweet engagement and reach\n- Monitor follower activity\n- Report on hashtag and campaign performance\n\nHow It Works\nAll integrations follow secure OAuth authentication, meaning you‚Äôre always in control of what data Prospectify can access. APIs have rate limits and require approved scopes, which we manage to ensure smooth, reliable syncing.\n\nWhy This Matters\nBy combining your social media analytics with Prospectify‚Äôs location intelligence and demographic insights, you get a true 360¬∞ view of your marketing efforts ‚Äî without switching between multiple dashboards.\n\nReady to connect your accounts?\nLog in to Prospectify ‚Üí Go to Settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Select your platform and sign in securely.`
