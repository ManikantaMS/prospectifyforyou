## Database Structure

```sql
-- Users table with role-based access
CREATE TABLE public.users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT,
  first_name TEXT,
  last_name TEXT,
  company_name TEXT,
  industry TEXT,
  role TEXT DEFAULT 'user',      -- 'admin' | 'user'
  approved BOOLEAN DEFAULT false, -- Requires admin approval
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- RLS policies ensure:
-- - Admins can see/update all users
-- - Users can only see/update their own record
```
